# PerlinRiver
Processing code to draw autonomous rivers, with the water lines avoiding rocks. Output is a PDF that can be imported into InkScape, Illustrator, et al and then plotted on your favorite pen plotter (like an AxiDraw).

Note: if you are plotting to an AxiDraw, it is better to plot with constant-speed enabled due to the number of small line segments in the image.
